#  People's accidental fall detection (In progress)

## 1. Introduction

The application aims at giving alert on any accidental falls of people living by themselves using human pose estimation. The application uses algorithm from paper [Realtime Multi-Person 2D Pose Estimation using Part Affifinity Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08050) to generate the human pose feature points. And calculate the angle between human body and floor to see whether one person is on the ground for more than five seconds.
